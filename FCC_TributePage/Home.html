  <p>Dr. Verghese Kurien, a social entrepreneur whose "billion-litre idea", Operation Flood – the world's largest agricultural dairy development programme, made dairy farming India's largest self-sustaining industry and the largest rural employment provider. It made India the world's largest milk producer from a milk-deficient nation, which doubled milk available per person and increased milk output four-fold, in 30 years.</p>
  <p> Dr Kurien attained his degree in B.Sc in Physics from Loyola College in Madras.  On returning to India after completion of his studies, </p>
    <h4> His Journey to become the Milkman of India:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> 1940 : Attained his degree in B.Sc in Physics from Loyola College in Madras. </li>
    <li> 1943 : Attained bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the College of Engineering, Madras. </li>
    <li> 1948 : He was chosen to study <em>Dairy engineering</em> under Govt. of India scholarsip and went on to the United States of America but returned with a degree in Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering by choosing some dairy electives.</li>
    <li> 1949 : He headed for <em>Anand</em>, a place in Kaira district of Gujarat where he was supposed to spend five years as an officer of the Dairy division in return for the scholarship paid by the government.</li>
    <li> 1950 : He started noticing the movement of the farmers in the village and admired the qualities of their leader, Tribhuvandas Patel. On the insistance of Tribhuvandas Patel, joined the <em>'Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union Limited (KDCMPUL)'</em> cooperative as General Manager and helped Tribhuvandas Patel in setting up a new dairy in the village.</li>
      <li> 1955 : He along with dairy engineer<em> H. M. Dalaya</em>, started experimenting to obtain skim milk powder and condensed milk from abundant buffalo milk instead of cow milk whose supply is short in India thus giving a strong competition to Europe's Nestle.</li>
      <li> 1957 : <strong>'AMUL'</strong> was born which stood as an acronym for Anand Milk Union Limited derived from a sanskrit word 'AMULYA' meaning priceless.</li>
      <li> 1960 :  Later research by<em> Dr. G. H. Wilster</em> led to cheese production from buffalo milk at Amul.</li>
      <li> 1965 : Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri tasked Kurien to replicate the dairy's 'Anand pattern' nationwide for which, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was founded under Kurien, independent of governmental control.</li>
      <li> 1970 : His <em>"Billion-litre idea"</em> to stem the movement of high-yield cattle of native breeds to urban areas, which subsequently, would face needless slaughter, reverse this flow by setting up milksheds & dairies all over the nation and stabilise the markets of big cities for their ensuing produce.</li>
      <li> 1979 : He founded the <em>Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA)</em> to groom managers for the cooperatives. Premier Alexei Kosygin invited Kurien to the Soviet Union for advice on the cooperatives there. </li>
      <li> 1982 : Pakistan invited him to set up dairy cooperatives, where he went leading a World Bank mission.</li>
      <li> 1989 : China implemented its own Operation-Flood like programme with the help of Kurien and the World Food Programme.</li>
</ul>

Kurien's support was crucial in making, the <em>'Amul girl'</em> ad campaign (advertising with a larger public message), one of the longest running for decades now.
